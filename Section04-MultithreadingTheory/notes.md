## 🧩 **Section 4 — Multithreading Theory**

### 🎯 **Objectives**

By the end of this section, you’ll clearly understand:

1. What **processes** and **threads** are, and how they differ.
2. The **time-slicing algorithm** used by the CPU for scheduling.
3. Key **benefits** and **downsides** of multithreading.
4. The **thread lifecycle** and its states in Java.

## 🧠 **Key Concepts**

### 🧱 1. Process vs Thread

| Feature        | Process                                      | Thread                                               |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition     | Independent program in execution             | Smallest unit of CPU execution within a process      |
| Memory Space   | Has its **own memory space**                 | Shares memory with other threads in the same process |
| Communication  | Expensive (IPC needed)                       | Cheap — threads share heap memory                    |
| Failure Impact | If a process fails, it doesn’t affect others | If one thread crashes, it may corrupt shared state   |
| Example        | Running `chrome.exe`, `idea64.exe`           | Tabs in Chrome, background tasks in IntelliJ         |

✅ **Analogy:**
Think of a process as a **company** and threads as its **employees** sharing the same office (resources).

### ⚙️ 2. What is a Time-Slicing Algorithm?

**Definition:**
Time-slicing (also known as **Round Robin scheduling**) is how an OS gives each runnable thread a **small slice of CPU time**.

Each thread runs for a brief moment (say 10–15ms), then the CPU switches to another thread.
This creates the *illusion of parallelism* even on a single-core CPU.

🧩 **In Java:**
The OS handles time-slicing; the JVM doesn’t control it directly.

```java
public class TimeSlicingDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable task = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " - iteration " + i);
                try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) { }
            }
        };

        Thread t1 = new Thread(task, "Thread-A");
        Thread t2 = new Thread(task, "Thread-B");
        Thread t3 = new Thread(task, "Thread-C");

        t1.start(); t2.start(); t3.start();
    }
}
```

🧠 **Note:**
Even though there’s only one CPU core, you’ll see **interleaved output** due to time-slicing.

### 🚀 3. Benefits of Multithreading

✅ **Parallelism / Concurrency** — do multiple tasks “simultaneously”.
✅ **Responsiveness** — UI thread isn’t blocked (e.g., background downloads).
✅ **Resource Utilization** — CPU cores are better used.
✅ **Scalability** — apps can handle higher loads with concurrent tasks.
✅ **Better performance** — especially for I/O-bound tasks.

**Example:**
In a web server, one thread can handle each request — serving thousands of clients concurrently.

---

### ⚠️ 4. Downsides of Multithreading

❌ **Complex debugging** — timing-related bugs are non-deterministic.
❌ **Synchronization overhead** — locking shared data reduces speed.
❌ **Deadlocks** and **race conditions** can occur easily.
❌ **Context switching cost** — excessive threads can hurt performance.
❌ **Memory contention** — multiple threads writing to shared memory cause cache misses.

**Example:**
If two threads increment a shared variable without synchronization, results are unpredictable.

### 🔁 5. Thread Lifecycle in Java

Each thread in Java moves through the following states:

```
NEW → RUNNABLE → RUNNING → BLOCKED/WAITING → TERMINATED
```

| State               | Description                              | Trigger                       |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **NEW**             | Thread object created but not started    | `new Thread()`                |
| **RUNNABLE**        | Thread eligible to run (waiting for CPU) | `start()`                     |
| **RUNNING**         | Thread is executing                      | OS schedules it               |
| **WAITING/BLOCKED** | Thread paused or waiting for lock        | `wait()`, `sleep()`, `join()` |
| **TERMINATED**      | Thread execution completed               | run() ends or exception       |

**Example:**

```java
public class ThreadLifecycleDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Thread state during run(): " + Thread.currentThread().getState());
        });

        System.out.println("Before start(): " + thread.getState());
        thread.start();
        Thread.sleep(100); // give time for thread to run
        System.out.println("After start(): " + thread.getState());
    }
}
```

🧩 Output Example:

```
Before start(): NEW
Thread state during run(): RUNNABLE
After start(): TERMINATED
```

## 💪 Hands-on Exercises

### 🧩 Easy

1. Write a Java program to create **two threads**, each printing numbers from 1–5 with different delays.
   Observe the interleaving pattern due to **time-slicing**.

### ⚙️ Medium

2. Create **three threads** representing different processes — for example:

    * Email sender
    * File downloader
    * Logger
      Simulate concurrent execution using `Thread.sleep()` for different durations.

### 🔬 Hard

3. Simulate **CPU time-slicing** manually:
   Create multiple threads and pause each using `sleep()` to mimic round-robin scheduling.

## 💼 Common Interview Questions

1. What is the difference between process and thread?
2. How does Java achieve multithreading?
3. What is time-slicing, and who controls it?
4. What are the main states of a thread in Java?
5. What are race conditions and how do you prevent them?
6. What are potential drawbacks of multithreading?

---

## 🚨 Red Flags / Mistakes

* Calling `run()` instead of `start()` — thread won’t start in parallel.
* Forgetting synchronization when accessing shared data.
* Using `Thread.sleep()` to “control” concurrency (should use `wait/notify` or locks).
* Assuming thread scheduling order — it’s **OS dependent**, never guaranteed.
