# üß© Section 5 ‚Äî Threads Manipulation (Theory Deep Dive)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 1. What Is a Thread?

A **thread** is the smallest unit of execution within a process.
Every Java program starts with at least **one thread ‚Äî the main thread** ‚Äî created automatically by the JVM.

Multiple threads in the same process **share**:

* Code section
* Heap memory (objects)
* Open files and sockets

‚Ä¶but each has its own:

* **Program counter (PC)**
* **Call stack**
* **Local variables**

Threads allow **concurrent** or even **parallel** execution of tasks.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Creating Threads ‚Äî Two Main Approaches

### üîπ a) Extending the `Thread` class

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running in: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
new MyThread().start();
```

* Simpler for quick examples
* But restricts you (Java doesn‚Äôt support multiple inheritance)

---

### üîπ b) Implementing `Runnable`

```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running in: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
new Thread(new MyRunnable()).start();
```

‚úÖ **Preferred way** ‚Äî because:

* Decouples the **task** (Runnable) from the **Thread** (executor)
* Enables reusing the same task with different threads
* Fits well with `ExecutorService` and modern concurrency utilities

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. `start()` vs `run()`

| Method    | What it Does                                                    | Thread Behavior   |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `start()` | Creates a new call stack and runs `run()` in **another thread** | Runs concurrently |
| `run()`   | Executes the method in the **same thread**                      | No concurrency    |

**Rule:** Always call `start()` ‚Äî calling `run()` directly just runs sequentially.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. `sleep()`, `yield()`, and `join()`

### üí§ `sleep(long ms)`

Temporarily pauses **current thread** for given milliseconds.

* Doesn‚Äôt release locks
* Other threads continue to run
* Throws `InterruptedException` if interrupted

> Used to simulate delays or control execution timing.

---

### ü§ù `join()`

Waits for another thread to finish before continuing.

```java
Thread t = new Thread(task);
t.start();
t.join(); // main waits here until t completes
```

* Makes threads run *in order* when needed
* Used for sequencing or synchronization

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è `yield()`

Hints to the scheduler that current thread is willing to pause
and let other threads of equal priority run.

> Note: It‚Äôs a **hint**, not a command ‚Äî OS may ignore it.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 5. User Threads vs Worker Threads vs Daemon Threads

Let‚Äôs clarify all three (they‚Äôre often conflated in interviews).

---

### üß© **User Threads (a.k.a. Foreground Threads)**

* Created by default when you call `new Thread(...)`
* JVM **waits** for all user threads to finish before exiting
* Represent **main tasks** of your program (business logic, computation, etc.)

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Daemon Threads (a.k.a. Background Threads)**

* Created explicitly via `setDaemon(true)` before `start()`
* JVM **does not wait** for them when shutting down
* Used for background maintenance (GC, cleanup, monitoring)
* If **only daemon threads** remain, JVM exits immediately

**Example:**

```java
Thread cleaner = new Thread(() -> {
    while(true) {
        System.out.println("Cleaning temporary files...");
        try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}
    }
});
cleaner.setDaemon(true);
cleaner.start();
```

üß† When `main()` (user thread) ends ‚Üí JVM terminates ‚Üí daemon thread stops abruptly.

---

### üß† **Worker Threads**

* General term for threads that **perform actual work** in a system (e.g., thread pool workers).
* They are usually **user threads** created by an `ExecutorService`.
* Not a special JVM type ‚Äî just a naming convention for threads that process tasks.

**Summary:**

| Type              | JVM Waits? | Purpose            | Creation                    |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **User Thread**   | ‚úÖ Yes      | Core app logic     | Default                     |
| **Worker Thread** | ‚úÖ Yes      | Executes tasks     | Usually via ExecutorService |
| **Daemon Thread** | ‚ùå No       | Background helpers | `setDaemon(true)`           |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 6. Thread Priority

Each thread has a **priority (1‚Äì10)**:

```java
Thread.MIN_PRIORITY  = 1
Thread.NORM_PRIORITY = 5
Thread.MAX_PRIORITY  = 10
```

Set it using:

```java
thread.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
```

**Purpose:**
To *suggest* to the JVM/OS scheduler which threads are more important.

---

### üß† Why Priorities Might Be Ignored

| Reason                       | Explanation                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üß© **OS-Level Scheduling**   | The JVM delegates actual scheduling to the OS kernel ‚Äî it may ignore priorities for fairness.             |
| ‚öôÔ∏è **CPU Core Availability** | On multicore systems, each thread can run on its own core ‚Äî so priority differences don‚Äôt visibly matter. |
| üîÑ **JVM Implementation**    | Some JVMs normalize priorities internally (e.g., mapping 1‚Äì10 to fewer native levels).                    |
| üßç **User Threads Dominate** | If all threads are CPU-bound and no blocking occurs, higher priority doesn‚Äôt help much.                   |

üìå **Result:** Thread priority is a ‚Äúhint‚Äù, not a guarantee.
The OS may still choose to run lower-priority threads first.

---

### üßÆ Example

```java
Thread high = new Thread(job, "High");
Thread low  = new Thread(job, "Low");

high.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
low.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);

high.start();
low.start();
```

You might *expect* `high` to always finish first,
but output often alternates or is completely random.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 7. The Java Thread Scheduler

* Java threads are **mapped to native OS threads** (1:1 model).
* The OS kernel (not JVM) decides **which thread runs when**.
* Scheduling policy depends on platform:

    * Windows ‚Üí time-slicing + priority
    * Linux ‚Üí preemptive round-robin (priority & fairness based)

You **can‚Äôt directly control** scheduling, but can influence it using:

* `yield()`
* `sleep()`
* Priorities

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 8. Sequential vs Multithreaded Execution

### üîπ Sequential

All tasks execute one after another in the same thread.

```java
task1();
task2();
```

üïë Slower for I/O-heavy or independent operations.

---

### üîπ Multithreaded

Tasks execute concurrently in separate threads:

```java
new Thread(() -> task1()).start();
new Thread(() -> task2()).start();
```

üß† **Faster** if:

* Tasks are independent
* CPU has multiple cores
* Or tasks are I/O-bound (waiting on network, disk, etc.)

üß± **Slower** if:

* Tasks are small (thread creation overhead)
* CPU is already saturated
* Threads constantly contend for shared resources

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 9. Showing All JVM Threads

```java
Thread.getAllStackTraces().keySet()
    .forEach(t -> System.out.println(t.getName() + " (Daemon: " + t.isDaemon() + ")"));
```

This shows:

```
main (Daemon: false)
Reference Handler (Daemon: true)
Finalizer (Daemon: true)
Signal Dispatcher (Daemon: true)
```

‚úÖ Useful for debugging what threads exist in your program.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 10. When Does the JVM Exit?

The JVM shuts down when:

1. All **user threads** have finished,
2. Or `System.exit()` is called,
3. Or a fatal error/exception stops the process.

Daemon threads are **abruptly terminated** when the last user thread finishes ‚Äî
no `finally` blocks or clean shutdown guaranteed.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 11. Thread Groups (Legacy Concept)

Before `ExecutorService`, Java grouped threads using `ThreadGroup`.
It‚Äôs mostly obsolete now but still visible in some APIs.

```java
ThreadGroup group = new ThreadGroup("MyGroup");
Thread t = new Thread(group, new Task(), "Worker");
```

Used for:

* Monitoring multiple threads together
* Setting uncaught exception handlers

Modern approach ‚Üí use `Executors` or structured concurrency.

| Can a daemon thread create user threads?                   | Yes, child inherits daemon status from parent unless explicitly changed |

| Why might thread priority be ignored?                      | Because OS scheduler ultimately decides execution order                 |
| How do you ensure JVM exits only after background cleanup? | Use `join()` or `ExecutorService.shutdown()` instead of daemon threads  |
| When is multithreading slower than sequential?             | When tasks are short, CPU-bound, or heavily synchronized                |
