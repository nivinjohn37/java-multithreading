# 🧩 **Section 7.1 — Deadlocks and Livelocks**

---

## ⚙️ 1️⃣ What is a Deadlock?

### 🔹 Definition:

A **deadlock** occurs when two or more threads are **waiting for each other’s locks**,
so **none of them can ever proceed** — they are stuck permanently.

In simple words:

> "Thread A is waiting for a lock held by Thread B,
> and Thread B is waiting for a lock held by Thread A."

They both keep waiting — forever.

---

### 💡 Real-life analogy:

Imagine two people trying to pass each other in a narrow hallway:

* Person A: “You go first.”
* Person B: “No, you go first.”
  They both wait forever. 🧍‍♂️🧍‍♀️

That’s a deadlock.

---

### 🧱 Java Example (Conceptual)

```java
class Resource {}

public class DeadlockExample {
    private final Resource lock1 = new Resource();
    private final Resource lock2 = new Resource();

    Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
        synchronized (lock1) {
            System.out.println("Thread 1: locked lock1");
            try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
            synchronized (lock2) {
                System.out.println("Thread 1: locked lock2");
            }
        }
    });

    Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
        synchronized (lock2) {
            System.out.println("Thread 2: locked lock2");
            try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
            synchronized (lock1) {
                System.out.println("Thread 2: locked lock1");
            }
        }
    });
}
```

### 🧠 What happens here:

* Thread 1 locks `lock1`, waits for `lock2`.
* Thread 2 locks `lock2`, waits for `lock1`.
  → Neither can proceed → **deadlock**.

## ⚙️ 2️⃣ Deadlock Conditions (The Four Coffin Nails)

According to **Coffman’s conditions**, all 4 must be true for a deadlock to occur:

| Condition               | Meaning                                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Mutual Exclusion** | Only one thread can hold a lock at a time.          |
| **2. Hold and Wait**    | Thread holds one lock and waits for another.        |
| **3. No Preemption**    | Locks can’t be forcibly taken away.                 |
| **4. Circular Wait**    | Thread A waits for Thread B’s lock, and vice versa. |

If you **break any one of these**, deadlock cannot occur.

---

### 💡 Example: Breaking Circular Wait

Always lock resources in the same global order.

```java
// Always lock lock1 before lock2
synchronized(lock1) {
    synchronized(lock2) {
        // safe
    }
}
```

This eliminates circular waiting.

---

## ⚙️ 3️⃣ How to Prevent Deadlocks

| Strategy                               | How it Helps                                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lock ordering**                      | Always acquire locks in the same sequence.                          |
| **TryLock (ReentrantLock)**            | Try to acquire lock with timeout — if unavailable, retry later.     |
| **Deadlock detection**                 | Monitor thread states in debugging tools like VisualVM or jconsole. |
| **Avoid nested locks**                 | Use smaller synchronized sections.                                  |
| **Use higher-level concurrency tools** | e.g., `ExecutorService`, `Semaphore`, `CountDownLatch`.             |

---

### 💡 Example of `tryLock()` deadlock avoidance

```java
ReentrantLock lock1 = new ReentrantLock();
ReentrantLock lock2 = new ReentrantLock();

Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
    try {
        if (lock1.tryLock(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
            Thread.sleep(50);
            if (lock2.tryLock(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
                System.out.println("Thread 1 acquired both locks");
                lock2.unlock();
            }
            lock1.unlock();
        }
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
});
```

If a lock can’t be acquired, thread backs off — **no circular wait**.

---

## ⚙️ 4️⃣ What is a Livelock?

### 🔹 Definition:

In a **livelock**, threads are not blocked — they are *actively running*,
but **they keep responding to each other in a way that no progress is made**.

> Both are trying to avoid deadlock — but end up stuck in a loop of politeness.

---

### 💡 Real-life analogy:

Two people walking toward each other:

* Both move left to avoid collision — still blocked.
* Both move right — still blocked.
  They keep moving but **never pass each other**.

That’s **livelock**.

---

### 🧱 Java Example (Conceptual)

```java
class Livelock {
    private boolean resource1Available = true;
    private boolean resource2Available = true;

    public void task1() {
        while (resource1Available) {
            System.out.println("Task1 trying...");
            resource1Available = false;
            if (!resource2Available) {
                resource1Available = true; // give up
                continue;
            }
            System.out.println("Task1 done!");
            break;
        }
    }

    public void task2() {
        while (resource2Available) {
            System.out.println("Task2 trying...");
            resource2Available = false;
            if (!resource1Available) {
                resource2Available = true; // give up
                continue;
            }
            System.out.println("Task2 done!");
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

Here both keep releasing and retrying → **active waiting**, but no progress.

## ⚙️ 5️⃣ Difference Between Deadlock and Livelock

| Aspect        | Deadlock                          | Livelock                                  |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Threads State | Blocked (waiting)                 | Running (active)                          |
| CPU Usage     | 0% (sleeping)                     | High (busy spinning)                      |
| Progress      | None                              | None                                      |
| Example       | Two threads each holding one lock | Two threads repeatedly releasing/retrying |
| Fix           | Lock ordering, timeouts           | Add randomness, backoff delays            |

---

## ⚙️ 6️⃣ What is Starvation (for completeness)?

> A thread is **starved** when it never gets a chance to execute
> because higher-priority or greedy threads keep acquiring locks first.

Example:

* Low-priority thread never gets CPU time.
* Thread never obtains lock due to unfair scheduling.

---

### 🧠 Example:

```java
ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock(false); // non-fair lock
```

If one thread keeps reacquiring lock quickly, others may starve.
You can fix it using:

```java
ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock(true); // fair lock
```

---

## 🧾 **Summary (Memory Snapshot)**

* **Deadlock** → threads *waiting forever*
* **Livelock** → threads *running forever but doing nothing*
* **Starvation** → thread *never scheduled*
* **Prevention** → lock ordering, `tryLock`, fairness
* **Detection** → `ThreadMXBean.findDeadlockedThreads()`

---

Perfect, Nivin 🔥 — this next part (topics **36–38**) is absolutely foundational to mastering Java’s **Memory Model (JMM)** and understanding how **visibility**, **atomicity**, and **safe thread termination** work.

These are not just theory points — they directly explain why certain multi-threaded code behaves *weirdly* under load, and interviewers love testing this exact reasoning.

Let’s go step-by-step.

---

# 🧩 **Section 7.2 — Volatile, Atomic Variables, and Safe Thread Stopping**

---

## ⚙️ 1️⃣ What is the Java Memory Model (JMM)?

Before we understand `volatile` and `AtomicInteger`, we must understand **what problem they solve**.

### 🔹 The Problem: CPU Caches and Thread Visibility

Each thread runs on a CPU core that might **cache variables locally**.
This means:

* One thread might **not immediately see updates** made by another thread.
* Even though they share the same variable, each might be using a different cached copy.

💡 **Result:** The value in RAM (main memory) ≠ value in thread’s CPU register.

---

### 🧱 Example: Visibility Problem

```java
class VisibilityProblem {
    private static boolean running = true;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
            while (running) {  } // expects main to set running = false
        });
        t.start();

        Thread.sleep(1000);
        running = false; // main thread updates value
        System.out.println("Flag changed to false");
    }
}
```

🧠 **What you expect:**
Loop stops after 1 second.

❌ **What happens in reality:**
It may run *forever!* — because the worker thread never sees the updated `running` flag (cached copy).

---

## ⚙️ 2️⃣ The `volatile` Keyword — Fixing Visibility

### 🔹 Definition:

> `volatile` is a **lightweight synchronization keyword** that guarantees **visibility** and **ordering**, but *not atomicity.*

When a variable is declared as `volatile`:

* Every read happens directly from **main memory**.
* Every write is **immediately flushed** to main memory.

---

### ✅ Fixing the previous example:

```java
class VolatileFix {
    private static volatile boolean running = true;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
            while (running) {  }  // sees latest value always
        });
        t.start();

        Thread.sleep(1000);
        running = false;
        System.out.println("Flag changed to false");
    }
}
```

✅ Output: Thread now stops properly after 1 second.

---

### ⚙️ What `volatile` guarantees:

1. **Visibility** → all threads see the latest value.
2. **Ordering** → writes before a volatile write are visible to threads after that volatile read.

---

### ⚙️ What `volatile` does *not* guarantee:

* **Atomic operations** (like `count++`)
* Mutual exclusion

---

### 💡 Example: Why `volatile int count` is *not* safe

```java
volatile int count = 0;

void increment() {
    count++; // Not atomic!
}
```

This expands to:

```
read count
increment
write back
```

Between those steps, another thread may modify `count`.

---

## ⚙️ 3️⃣ `volatile` vs `synchronized`

| Feature            | `volatile`                    | `synchronized`              |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Ensures visibility | ✅                             | ✅                           |
| Ensures atomicity  | ❌                             | ✅                           |
| Lock overhead      | None                          | High                        |
| Use case           | Flags, status, config updates | Critical sections, counters |
| Reentrant          | N/A                           | Yes                         |
| Wait/notify        | ❌                             | ✅                           |

---

## ⚙️ 4️⃣ Safely Stopping Threads

Using a **volatile flag** is the clean, modern way to stop threads safely.

### 🧱 Example:

```java
class StoppableTask implements Runnable {
    private volatile boolean running = true;

    public void run() {
        while (running) {
            System.out.println("Working...");
        }
    }

    public void stop() {
        running = false;
    }
}
```

This works because `volatile` ensures the stop signal is seen immediately.

---

### ⚠️ Why not use `Thread.stop()`?

> It’s **deprecated** because it can terminate a thread while it holds locks,
> potentially leaving shared data in an inconsistent state.

---

## ⚙️ 5️⃣ Atomic Variables

Now we solve the **atomicity** issue that `volatile` can’t handle.

---

### 🔹 What are Atomic Variables?

Classes in `java.util.concurrent.atomic` (e.g., `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong`, `AtomicReference`)
use **lock-free, hardware-level atomic instructions (CAS – Compare-And-Swap)**
to ensure atomic updates.

---

### 💡 Example: Safe Counter Using `AtomicInteger`

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class AtomicCounter {
    private AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);

    public void increment() {
        count.incrementAndGet();  // atomic
    }

    public int get() {
        return count.get();
    }
}
```

Unlike a `volatile int`, this ensures **no race conditions** even with 100 threads incrementing concurrently.

---

### ⚙️ Common Atomic Methods

| Method                            | Description                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `get()`                           | Returns current value                       |
| `set(value)`                      | Sets new value                              |
| `incrementAndGet()`               | Atomically increments and returns new value |
| `getAndIncrement()`               | Returns current value, then increments      |
| `compareAndSet(expected, update)` | Updates only if current == expected         |

---

### 💡 Example: CAS (Compare-And-Swap)

```java
AtomicInteger a = new AtomicInteger(10);
boolean success = a.compareAndSet(10, 20); // true
```

If current value = 10 → sets to 20.
If not → fails silently (returns false).

This avoids locks entirely and uses CPU atomic instructions instead.

---

## ⚙️ 6️⃣ Combining volatile + Atomic

Sometimes, you may combine them for clarity:

* `volatile boolean` for **flags** (visibility)
* `AtomicInteger` for **shared counters** (atomicity)

---

### 💡 Example: Graceful thread termination with counter

```java
class Worker implements Runnable {
    private static AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);
    private volatile boolean running = true;

    public void run() {
        while (running) {
            counter.incrementAndGet();
        }
    }

    public void stop() { running = false; }
}
```

---

## ⚙️ 7️⃣ `volatile` and Happens-Before Relationship

Java Memory Model guarantees:

If thread A writes to a `volatile` variable and thread B reads it,
then:

> all writes before that volatile write in A
> happen-before
> all reads after that volatile read in B.

That ensures **visibility ordering** between threads.

| When should we use `volatile`?                     | For flags, status indicators, or simple signals.                                  |
| Is `count++` atomic if count is volatile?          | No, it’s 3 separate operations.                                                   |
| How do atomic classes work?                        | Use hardware-level CAS (Compare-And-Swap).                                        |
| Why not use `Thread.stop()`?                       | It’s unsafe and deprecated — may corrupt shared data.                             |
| How can you safely stop a thread?                  | Use a volatile flag and exit gracefully.                                          |

## 💬 Interview Trick Question Example

> **Q:** Can a volatile variable be used as a lock?
> **A:** No. It only provides visibility and ordering, but no mutual exclusion. Multiple threads can still write simultaneously.

✅ **You now fully understand the core Java Memory Model principles:**

* Visibility (volatile)
* Atomicity (Atomic Variables)
* Safe thread termination

Excellent choice, Nivin 👏 — we’ve reached **the synchronization heavyweights**:
**Semaphores**, **Mutexes**, and **Binary Semaphores** — Section 7’s final and most powerful concepts.

These are used everywhere in real-world concurrency — from databases and APIs to I/O and microservices — so once you master them, your mental model of multithreading becomes complete and interview-proof.

Let’s go step by step like before. 🧩

---

# 🧩 **Section 7.3 — Semaphores, Mutexes, and Binary Semaphores**

---

## ⚙️ 1️⃣ What is a Semaphore?

### 🔹 Definition

A **semaphore** is a **thread synchronization construct** that controls access to a shared resource through the use of **permits**.

* It maintains a count of how many threads can access a resource simultaneously.
* Threads must **acquire()** a permit before entering, and **release()** it after leaving.

---

### 💡 Real-Life Analogy

Think of a **parking lot with 3 parking spots**:

* Only 3 cars (threads) can enter at a time.
* When one car leaves (releases a spot), another car waiting outside can enter.

---

### 🧱 Basic Example: Semaphore with 3 Permits

```java
import java.util.concurrent.Semaphore;

public class ParkingLot {
    private static final Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(3); // 3 permits

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            Thread car = new Thread(() -> {
                try {
                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " waiting for parking spot...");
                    semaphore.acquire(); // occupy one spot
                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " parked!");
                    Thread.sleep(2000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                } finally {
                    semaphore.release(); // free up a spot
                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " left the parking lot.");
                }
            }, "Car-" + i);
            car.start();
        }
    }
}
```

### 🧠 Behavior:

* Only 3 cars park at a time.
* The other 2 must wait until a spot frees up.

## ⚙️ 2️⃣ Semaphore Operations

| Method               | Description                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `acquire()`          | Decreases permit count by 1 (waits if none available)   |
| `tryAcquire()`       | Tries to acquire a permit; doesn’t block if unavailable |
| `release()`          | Increases permit count by 1                             |
| `availablePermits()` | Returns number of available permits                     |
| `drainPermits()`     | Acquires and returns all available permits at once      |

---

## ⚙️ 3️⃣ Semaphore Types

| Type                   | Constructor                  | Description                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Counting Semaphore** | `new Semaphore(int permits)` | Allows multiple threads to access simultaneously |
| **Binary Semaphore**   | `new Semaphore(1)`           | Allows only 1 thread — acts like a lock (mutex)  |

---

## ⚙️ 4️⃣ Binary Semaphore

### 💡 Definition:

A **binary semaphore** is a special semaphore with only **one permit** —
so only one thread can access the resource at any time.

### 🧱 Example: Binary Semaphore as Lock

```java
import java.util.concurrent.Semaphore;

public class BinarySemaphoreExample {
    private static final Semaphore binary = new Semaphore(1);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable task = () -> {
            try {
                binary.acquire(); // critical section
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " acquired the lock");
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            } finally {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " releasing the lock");
                binary.release();
            }
        };

        new Thread(task, "Thread-1").start();
        new Thread(task, "Thread-2").start();
    }
}
```

🧠 Output (serial execution):

```
Thread-1 acquired the lock
Thread-1 releasing the lock
Thread-2 acquired the lock
Thread-2 releasing the lock
```

So a **binary semaphore acts just like a `synchronized` block**,
but with finer control (`tryAcquire`, fairness, etc.).

---

## ⚙️ 5️⃣ Mutex (Mutual Exclusion Lock)

### 🔹 Definition:

A **mutex** (mutual exclusion object) allows only one thread to access a resource at a time —
conceptually same as a **binary semaphore**, but with **ownership semantics**.

Meaning:

* The thread that acquires the mutex must be the one that releases it.

---

### 🧠 Difference: Semaphore vs Mutex

| Aspect                    | Semaphore                        | Mutex                             |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Number of permits         | 1 or more                        | Always 1                          |
| Ownership                 | No concept of ownership          | Owned by the acquiring thread     |
| Release by another thread | Allowed                          | ❌ Not allowed                     |
| Main use                  | Limiting concurrency             | Enforcing exclusive access        |
| Provided by               | `java.util.concurrent.Semaphore` | `synchronized` or `ReentrantLock` |

---

### 💡 Example: Mutex with ReentrantLock

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class MutexExample {
    private static final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable task = () -> {
            try {
                lock.lock();
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " acquired lock");
                Thread.sleep(500);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            } finally {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " releasing lock");
                lock.unlock();
            }
        };

        new Thread(task, "Thread-1").start();
        new Thread(task, "Thread-2").start();
    }
}
```

---

## ⚙️ 6️⃣ Fair vs Non-Fair Semaphores and Locks

Both `Semaphore` and `ReentrantLock` can be created with fairness control.

```java
Semaphore sem = new Semaphore(3, true); // fair
ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock(true); // fair
```

**Fair = FIFO order** (first waiting thread gets the lock)
**Unfair = random order** (better performance, but possible starvation)

| Scenario                                       | Best Tool                | Why                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Limit concurrent API calls                     | Counting Semaphore       | Restrict concurrency to N        |
| Restrict DB connections                        | Counting Semaphore       | Limit to pool size               |
| Protect single resource (file, data structure) | Mutex / Binary Semaphore | Exclusive access                 |
| Implement read/write lock manually             | Semaphore (with permits) | Different permits for read/write |
| Thread-safe rate limiter                       | Semaphore + scheduler    | Control throughput               |

## ⚙️ 8️⃣ Advanced Example — Producer-Consumer with Semaphore

```java
import java.util.concurrent.Semaphore;
import java.util.LinkedList;

class BoundedBuffer {
    private final Semaphore full = new Semaphore(0);
    private final Semaphore empty = new Semaphore(5);
    private final Semaphore mutex = new Semaphore(1);
    private final LinkedList<Integer> buffer = new LinkedList<>();

    public void produce(int item) throws InterruptedException {
        empty.acquire();
        mutex.acquire();
        buffer.add(item);
        System.out.println("Produced: " + item);
        mutex.release();
        full.release();
    }

    public void consume() throws InterruptedException {
        full.acquire();
        mutex.acquire();
        int item = buffer.removeFirst();
        System.out.println("Consumed: " + item);
        mutex.release();
        empty.release();
    }
}
```

| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What is a semaphore?                                          | A synchronization aid that controls access using permits.                          |
| How does it differ from a lock?                               | A lock allows only one thread; semaphore allows N threads.                         |
| What’s the difference between a binary semaphore and a mutex? | Mutex has ownership; binary semaphore doesn’t.                                     |
| What is a fair semaphore?                                     | One that grants permits in FIFO order.                                             |
| Can one thread release a semaphore acquired by another?       | Yes, unlike a mutex.                                                               |
| When would you use a semaphore?                               | To control concurrent access to limited resources (like DB connections).           |
| What happens if you forget to release a semaphore?            | You can cause a resource leak — other threads will block forever.                  |
| What’s the performance tradeoff between semaphore and lock?   | Semaphore can coordinate multiple threads; lock is simpler but only one-at-a-time. |
