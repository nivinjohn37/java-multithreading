# üß≠ Section 8 ‚Äî Creating Threads with Executors

### **Complete Notes & Interview Guide**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction ‚Äî Why Executors?

### ‚ùå The Problem: Manual Thread Creation

Creating threads manually like this:

```java
new Thread(task).start();
```

works for small programs, but fails for scalability:

* Each thread = expensive OS resource (~1 MB stack memory).
* Frequent creation/destruction = context-switch overhead.
* No lifecycle control ‚Üí leaks, crashes, inconsistent behavior.

### ‚úÖ The Solution: Executor Framework

The **Executor Framework (Java 5+)** solves these by managing a **pool of worker threads**:

* Threads are **created once and reused**.
* Tasks are **queued** if all threads are busy.
* You get built-in tools for **scheduling**, **exception handling**, and **graceful shutdown**.

---

## üß† 2Ô∏è‚É£ Core Concepts

### üîπ `Executor`

Basic interface with one method:

```java
void execute(Runnable command);
```

### üîπ `ExecutorService`

Extends Executor ‚Äî adds lifecycle control:

```java
Future<?> submit(Runnable task);
void shutdown();
List<Runnable> shutdownNow();
boolean awaitTermination(...);
```

### üîπ `ThreadPoolExecutor` (core class)

All executor factory methods (like `Executors.newFixedThreadPool()`) return a `ThreadPoolExecutor` configured with:

```java
new ThreadPoolExecutor(corePoolSize, maxPoolSize,
                       keepAliveTime, timeUnit,
                       workQueue, threadFactory, rejectionHandler);
```

## üß© 3Ô∏è‚É£ Thread Lifecycle ‚Äî JVM vs OS

| Layer        | Responsibility                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OS**       | Creates & schedules native threads (kernel threads).    |
| **JVM**      | Manages Java `Thread` objects mapped 1:1 to OS threads. |
| **Executor** | Reuses threads, queues tasks, manages backpressure.     |

üß† **Key Insight:**

> Threads are still OS-level, but the **JVM manages them efficiently** through executors.
> This minimizes OS calls and maximizes reuse.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4Ô∏è‚É£ Core Building Blocks

### üî∏ `BlockingQueue`

Used to hold submitted tasks safely while workers are busy.
Example: `LinkedBlockingQueue`, `ArrayBlockingQueue`, `SynchronousQueue`.

* **Blocking behavior:**

    * Producer blocks if queue full.
    * Consumer blocks if queue empty.

Executors use these to control flow automatically.

---

## üß© 5Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Executors

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ SingleThreadExecutor**

**Code:**

```java
ExecutorService ex = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
```

**Internals:**

```java
new ThreadPoolExecutor(1, 1,
    0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,
    new LinkedBlockingQueue<>());
```

**Behavior:**

* One thread executes all tasks **sequentially (FIFO)**.
* If thread crashes ‚Üí new one is auto-created.
* Perfect ordering guaranteed.

**Use cases:**
‚úÖ Logging, sequential writes, ordered event handling.

**Example:**

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++)
    ex.submit(() -> System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()));
ex.shutdown();
```

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ FixedThreadPool**

**Code:**

```java
ExecutorService ex = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
```

**Internals:**

```java
new ThreadPoolExecutor(4, 4, 0L,
    TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new LinkedBlockingQueue<>());
```

**Behavior:**

* Fixed number of threads.
* Excess tasks wait in queue.
* Threads are reused until shutdown.

**Best for:** CPU-bound or predictable workloads.

**Example:**

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    int id = i;
    ex.submit(() -> {
        System.out.println("Task " + id);
        Thread.sleep(500);
    });
}
ex.shutdown();
```

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ CachedThreadPool**

**Code:**

```java
ExecutorService ex = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
```

**Internals:**

```java
new ThreadPoolExecutor(0, Integer.MAX_VALUE,
    60L, TimeUnit.SECONDS, new SynchronousQueue<>());
```

**Behavior:**

* Expands dynamically (creates new threads if all busy).
* No queue (direct hand-off).
* Idle threads die after 60 s.

**Best for:** short-lived, bursty I/O workloads (e.g., microservice requests).

**Caution:** may spawn too many threads if tasks arrive faster than they complete.

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ ScheduledThreadPool**

**Code:**

```java
ScheduledExecutorService ex = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(2);
```

**Behavior:**

* Executes tasks after delay or periodically.
* Safer replacement for `Timer`.

**Example:**

```java
ex.scheduleAtFixedRate(() ->
    System.out.println("Heartbeat " + System.currentTimeMillis()),
    0, 2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```

**Fixed-Rate vs Fixed-Delay:**

| Type            | Interval Measurement       | Example                |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Fixed Rate**  | Between start ‚Üí next start | Regular heartbeat      |
| **Fixed Delay** | Between end ‚Üí next start   | Retry after completion |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 6Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Queue Overflows ‚Äî `RejectedExecutionHandler`

When queue + pool are full ‚Üí executor calls a **Rejection Handler**.

**Built-ins:**

| Policy                | Behavior                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `AbortPolicy`         | Throw `RejectedExecutionException`         |
| `DiscardPolicy`       | Silently drop                              |
| `DiscardOldestPolicy` | Drop oldest queued task                    |
| `CallerRunsPolicy`    | Caller thread executes task (backpressure) |

**Custom Example:**

```java
new ThreadPoolExecutor(4, 4, 0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,
    new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(10),
    (r, ex) -> System.out.println("Task rejected: " + r));
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 7Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Exceptions

### üî∏ Runnable

No checked exceptions allowed ‚Äî handle manually:

```java
executor.submit(() -> {
    try { riskyWork(); }
    catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }
});
```

### üî∏ Callable

Exceptions captured in `Future`:

```java
Future<Integer> f = executor.submit(() -> {
    if (true) throw new Exception("Boom!");
    return 10;
});
try {
    f.get();
} catch (ExecutionException e) {
    System.out.println("Cause: " + e.getCause());
}
```

| Rule                                     | Why                                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Always call `shutdown()`                 | Gracefully release threads             |

## üí¨ 11Ô∏è‚É£ Interview Quick Answers

**Q:** What‚Äôs the benefit of Executors over new Thread()?
‚Üí Thread reuse, controlled lifecycle, task queueing, better resource management.

**Q:** What‚Äôs the difference between Fixed and Cached pool?
‚Üí Fixed = constant threads + queue; Cached = unbounded threads + no queue.

**Q:** How do you handle rejected tasks?
‚Üí With `RejectedExecutionHandler` (CallerRunsPolicy = backpressure).

**Q:** Difference between scheduleAtFixedRate & scheduleWithFixedDelay?
‚Üí FixedRate = start-to-start; FixedDelay = end-to-start.

**Q:** What is SynchronousQueue used for?
‚Üí Direct hand-off between producer and worker (no queue).

**Q:** Why use Callable over Runnable?
‚Üí Callable returns value and propagates exceptions via `Future`.

## üß© 12Ô∏è‚É£ Mini Quiz

1Ô∏è‚É£ What happens if you submit 1000 tasks to a FixedThreadPool of size 4?
‚Üí 4 run immediately, 996 wait in queue.

2Ô∏è‚É£ What happens in a CachedThreadPool if all threads are busy?
‚Üí New threads created instantly (until system limit).

3Ô∏è‚É£ How do you prevent unbounded queue growth?
‚Üí Use `ArrayBlockingQueue` with `CallerRunsPolicy`.

4Ô∏è‚É£ What happens if a task in a SingleThreadExecutor throws an exception?
‚Üí That thread dies; executor auto-creates a new one.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Difference between shutdown() and shutdownNow()?
‚Üí `shutdown()` waits for ongoing tasks; `shutdownNow()` interrupts them.

---

## üß† TL;DR Summary

> Executors abstract away the complexity of thread creation and management.
> They let you focus on *what* to run, not *how*.
> Choosing the right pool type and queue is the key to balancing **performance**, **stability**, and **scalability**.

---
Perfect üëå ‚Äî that‚Äôs *exactly* how we‚Äôll do it:
we‚Äôll go deep but clearly through **SingleThreadExecutor** and **FixedThreadPool** first, then move to **Cached** and **Scheduled** executors.

This will be one of the most practical sections, because once you fully understand these two, you‚Äôll have **95% of real-world executor mastery**.

---

## üß© **1Ô∏è‚É£ SingleThreadExecutor**

---

### üéØ **Concept**

A **SingleThreadExecutor** is an Executor that:

* Creates **only one worker thread**.
* Executes submitted tasks **sequentially**, one after another.
* Automatically creates a new thread if the existing one dies due to an exception.

This ensures **strict ordering** ‚Äî exactly one task executes at any moment.

---

### üí° **Use Case**

* Logging service ‚Äî preserve log order.
* Sequential file processing.
* Running multiple background tasks that must not overlap.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**

Under the hood, this:

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
```

creates a:

```java
new ThreadPoolExecutor(
    1, 1,
    0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,
    new LinkedBlockingQueue<Runnable>()
);
```

So:

* **corePoolSize = 1**
* **maxPoolSize = 1**
* **Queue = LinkedBlockingQueue** (unbounded)

Meaning ‚Üí all tasks are queued and executed by one single thread in **FIFO** order.

---

### üß† **Thread Behavior**

* Tasks never run in parallel.
* If one task fails, a new thread is automatically created to continue subsequent tasks.
* You don‚Äôt need to `join()` manually ‚Äî Executor handles it.

---

### üíª **Example 1 ‚Äî Sequential Task Execution**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class SingleThreadExecutorDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            int taskId = i;
            executor.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " ‚Üí Executing Task " + taskId);
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            });
        }

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

‚úÖ **Output (always ordered):**

```
pool-1-thread-1 ‚Üí Executing Task 1
pool-1-thread-1 ‚Üí Executing Task 2
pool-1-thread-1 ‚Üí Executing Task 3
pool-1-thread-1 ‚Üí Executing Task 4
pool-1-thread-1 ‚Üí Executing Task 5
```

Even though tasks are submitted almost simultaneously, they execute **in sequence**.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **If Thread Crashes**

```java
executor.submit(() -> {
    System.out.println("Task 1 running");
    throw new RuntimeException("Simulated failure");
});
executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Task 2 still runs!"));
```

‚úÖ A new thread will be created to run Task 2 ‚Äî Executor self-heals.

---

### üß† **When to Use**

* You want sequential execution but non-blocking submission.
* You want a single-thread worker but auto-recovery and task queueing.

---

## üß© **2Ô∏è‚É£ FixedThreadPool**

---

### üéØ **Concept**

A **FixedThreadPool** maintains a constant number of threads ‚Äî e.g., 4 threads.

If you submit more tasks than threads:

* Extra tasks **wait in queue** (`LinkedBlockingQueue`).
* When a thread finishes its task, it picks up the next task from the queue.

---

### üí° **Use Case**

* Processing 100 tasks with 4 parallel workers.
* CPU-bound operations where you want to utilize available cores efficiently.
* Parallel API calls or file parsing jobs.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works Internally**

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
```

creates:

```java
new ThreadPoolExecutor(
    4, 4,
    0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,
    new LinkedBlockingQueue<Runnable>()
);
```

| Parameter                       | Meaning                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **corePoolSize** = 4            | Minimum number of threads |
| **maxPoolSize** = 4             | Maximum threads (fixed)   |
| **Queue** = LinkedBlockingQueue | Holds waiting tasks       |

---

### üíª **Example 2 ‚Äî FixedThreadPool**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class FixedThreadPoolDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            int taskId = i;
            executor.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " started Task " + taskId);
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1500);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " finished Task " + taskId);
            });
        }

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

‚úÖ **Output (example):**

```
pool-1-thread-1 started Task 1
pool-1-thread-2 started Task 2
pool-1-thread-3 started Task 3
pool-1-thread-1 finished Task 1
pool-1-thread-1 started Task 4
pool-1-thread-2 finished Task 2
pool-1-thread-2 started Task 5
...
```

üß† **Observation:**

* 3 tasks run in parallel (since we have 3 threads).
* Others wait in the queue until a thread is free.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Key Differences vs SingleThreadExecutor**

| Feature          | SingleThreadExecutor        | FixedThreadPool                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Thread count     | 1                           | Fixed (e.g., 4)                             |
| Task execution   | Sequential                  | Parallel (up to thread count)               |
| Order guarantee  | Yes                         | Not guaranteed (depends on completion time) |
| Use case         | Ordered background tasks    | Parallel worker model                       |
| Failure recovery | Auto-restarts single thread | Auto-restarts any failed worker             |

---

### üß† **Thread Reuse in FixedThreadPool**

Threads in a FixedThreadPool:

* Stay alive until the executor is shut down.
* After a task finishes, the same thread immediately picks up the next queued task.
* No re-creation ‚Üí performance benefit.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **How ThreadPoolExecutor Chooses Threads**

1Ô∏è‚É£ If a worker thread is **idle**, reuse it.
2Ô∏è‚É£ If all workers are busy:

* Queue the new task in the **LinkedBlockingQueue**.
  3Ô∏è‚É£ When a worker finishes, it **polls** the queue for the next task.

---

### üí£ **What Happens if You Submit Thousands of Tasks?**

By default, `LinkedBlockingQueue` is **unbounded** ‚Üí
tasks are queued indefinitely ‚Üí potential **OutOfMemoryError**.

Hence, for large-scale systems, use **bounded queues**:

```java
new ThreadPoolExecutor(4, 4, 0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(100));
```

---

### üß† **Best Practice Tip**

For CPU-bound work:
üëâ Pool size ‚âà number of CPU cores (`Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()`)

For I/O-bound work:
üëâ Pool size ‚âà 2√ó CPU cores or more (threads spend time waiting for I/O).

---

Would you like to move on next to:
**3Ô∏è‚É£ CachedThreadPool** (dynamic, auto-expanding pool)
and **4Ô∏è‚É£ ScheduledThreadPool** (for delayed/periodic execution)?


---

## üß© The Situation: Bounded Queue Overflow

When you use a **bounded queue** in a `ThreadPoolExecutor`:

```java
ExecutorService executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
        4, 4,
        0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,
        new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(100) // bounded queue
);
```

you‚Äôre telling the executor:

> ‚ÄúI only allow 4 active threads, and at most 100 waiting tasks.‚Äù

Now imagine you submit **200 tasks**:

* First 4 ‚Üí start running immediately.
* Next 100 ‚Üí go into the queue.
* Remaining 96 ‚Üí **queue is full, and all threads are busy** ‚Üí
  Executor can‚Äôt accept more work.

At this moment, the **executor invokes a ‚Äúrejection policy.‚Äù**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è What Happens Next ‚Äî The Rejection Mechanism

The executor calls a **`RejectedExecutionHandler`** for every task it cannot accept.

You can configure this handler in the constructor:

```java
new ThreadPoolExecutor(
    4, 4,
    0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,
    new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(100),
    new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy() // default
);
```

---

## üß© Built-in Rejection Policies

| Policy                    | Behavior                                              | Typical Use Case                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AbortPolicy** (default) | Throws `RejectedExecutionException`.                  | You want to fail fast when overloaded.                           |
| **DiscardPolicy**         | Silently drops the task.                              | Fire-and-forget tasks, non-critical logs.                        |
| **DiscardOldestPolicy**   | Removes oldest task in queue, then enqueues new task. | When latest data is more important (e.g., real-time dashboards). |
| **CallerRunsPolicy**      | Executes task in the caller‚Äôs thread (synchronously). | Backpressure: slows the producer down naturally.                 |

---

### üí° Example ‚Äî Handling Overflow Gracefully

Let‚Äôs look at code that uses a **custom handler**:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ThreadPoolOverflowExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
                2, 2,
                0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,
                new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(3),
                (r, e) -> {
                    System.out.println("‚ö†Ô∏è Task rejected: " + r.toString());
                    // could log, retry, or redirect to another system
                }
        );

        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            final int taskId = i;
            executor.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " running task " + taskId);
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(2000);
                } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            });
        }

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

Once 2 threads + 3 queue slots are full, all further submissions trigger the handler.

## üß† Deep Insight: Why We Need a Bounded Queue

An **unbounded queue** (like `LinkedBlockingQueue`) can cause **OOM errors** in high-traffic systems ‚Äî tasks just keep piling up if threads can‚Äôt keep up.
A **bounded queue + rejection policy** acts as a **safety valve** to apply **backpressure**.

---

## üîÑ Recommended Real-World Strategies

### ‚úÖ 1. Use `CallerRunsPolicy`

This is often the safest default for server-side systems:

```java
new ThreadPoolExecutor(
    4, 4,
    0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,
    new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(100),
    new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy()
);
```

**Effect:**

* When overloaded, the submitting thread executes the task itself.
* This slows down task submission ‚Üí natural throttling.
* Prevents silent drops or crashes.

üß† This is a **self-regulating feedback loop** (the producer slows down).

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Custom Handler with Retry / Logging

```java
new ThreadPoolExecutor(
    4, 4,
    0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,
    new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(100),
    (r, executor) -> {
        try {
            System.out.println("Queue full ‚Äî retrying after 100ms");
            Thread.sleep(100);
            executor.submit(r); // simple retry logic
        } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
);
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Be cautious ‚Äî naive retries can still cause cascading overloads.
Better to use **rate limiting** or **task prioritization** in real apps.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Dynamic Thread Pool (in High Load)

If you expect spikes, allow more threads temporarily:

```java
new ThreadPoolExecutor(
    4, 8,                   // core=4, max=8
    60L, TimeUnit.SECONDS,  // extra threads live for 60s
    new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(50),
    new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy()
);
```

So when the queue fills and CPU is free, more threads spawn ‚Äî
then shrink back after idle time.

| Strategy                             | Description                             | Behavior Under Load    |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Unbounded Queue**                  | All tasks accepted                      | Memory can explode     |
| **Bounded Queue + AbortPolicy**      | Fail fast                               | Safe but harsh         |
| **Bounded Queue + CallerRunsPolicy** | Backpressure (caller helps)             | Safe and balanced      |
| **Bounded Queue + Custom Handler**   | Full control (retry, drop oldest, etc.) | Best for tuned systems |

---

### üß© TL;DR

> When a bounded executor queue overflows, the key is to **gracefully reject or throttle** ‚Äî not silently drop or crash.
> Use `CallerRunsPolicy` for auto-throttling, or implement your own `RejectedExecutionHandler` to log, retry, or drop intelligently.
---

## üß© 3Ô∏è‚É£ CachedThreadPool

---

### üéØ Concept

A **CachedThreadPool** is a **flexible, dynamic** executor that:

* Creates **new threads as needed**, but
* **Reuses** previously created threads when available, and
* **Terminates idle threads** after 60 seconds.

So it‚Äôs perfect for **short-lived**, **bursty** workloads (like network requests, message handling, or microservice endpoints).

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Internal Structure

When you do:

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
```

Under the hood, Java creates:

```java
new ThreadPoolExecutor(
    0, Integer.MAX_VALUE,
    60L, TimeUnit.SECONDS,
    new SynchronousQueue<Runnable>()
);
```

| Parameter                           | Meaning                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **corePoolSize = 0**                | No threads kept alive permanently                    |
| **maxPoolSize = Integer.MAX_VALUE** | Unlimited threads can be created (careful!)          |
| **keepAliveTime = 60s**             | Idle threads die after 60 seconds                    |
| **Queue = SynchronousQueue**        | No queue! Direct handoff between producer and thread |

---

### üß† What Makes It Unique

Unlike `LinkedBlockingQueue`, a **SynchronousQueue** has **no capacity**.
A task is handed **directly** to a thread. If no thread is free, a new one is created.

So:

* If tasks arrive quickly ‚Üí threads grow dynamically.
* If load drops ‚Üí unused threads die after 60s ‚Üí resources freed.

---

### üíª Example ‚Äî CachedThreadPool in Action

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class CachedThreadPoolDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();

        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            final int taskId = i;
            executor.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " started task " + taskId);
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " finished task " + taskId);
            });
        }

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

‚úÖ **Possible Output:**

```
pool-1-thread-1 started task 1
pool-1-thread-2 started task 2
pool-1-thread-3 started task 3
...
pool-1-thread-10 started task 10
```

üß© Notice ‚Äî it created **10 threads**, one per task, since no queue exists.
After all tasks complete, threads idle for 60s and then die.

| Pros                                    | Cons                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Extremely scalable for bursty workloads | Can create **too many threads** ‚Üí OutOfMemoryError       |
| Reuses idle threads efficiently         | No queue ‚Üí may overwhelm system if tasks arrive too fast |
| Great for I/O-bound work                | Dangerous for CPU-bound tasks                            |

---

### üí° Real-World Use

‚úÖ Microservices handling unpredictable request bursts
‚úÖ Background task executors that stay mostly idle
‚úÖ Caching systems where thread usage fluctuates

üö´ Not recommended for CPU-bound algorithms (use FixedThreadPool instead)

## üß© 4Ô∏è‚É£ ScheduledThreadPool

---

### üéØ Concept

A **ScheduledThreadPool** allows you to schedule tasks:

* After a **delay**
* Or **periodically** (at fixed rate or fixed delay)

It‚Äôs a **replacement for `java.util.Timer`**, but thread-safe, scalable, and exception-proof.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Internal Structure

```java
ScheduledExecutorService scheduler =
        Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(2);
```

Internally:

```java
new ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor(2);
```

| Parameter                    | Meaning                                            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **corePoolSize = 2**         | Keeps 2 threads alive for scheduled tasks          |
| **Queue = DelayedWorkQueue** | Tasks stored in time-order (like a priority queue) |

---

### üíª Example ‚Äî Delayed Task

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ScheduledExecutorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1);

        System.out.println("Scheduling task at: " + System.currentTimeMillis());
        scheduler.schedule(() -> {
            System.out.println("Executed after delay at: " + System.currentTimeMillis());
        }, 3, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

        scheduler.shutdown();
    }
}
```

‚úÖ **Output:**

```
Scheduling task at: 1696881201000
Executed after delay at: 1696881204000
```

Task executes ~3 seconds later.

---

### üíª Example ‚Äî Repeated Task (Fixed Rate)

```java
ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(2);

scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(() -> {
    System.out.println("Running at " + System.currentTimeMillis());
}, 0, 2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```

‚úÖ Output:

```
Running at 10:00:00.000
Running at 10:00:02.000
Running at 10:00:04.000
...
```

üí° `scheduleAtFixedRate()`

* Runs every **2 seconds**, measured **from the start** of each task.
* If one task takes 1 second, next starts after 1 more second.

---

### üíª Example ‚Äî Repeated Task (Fixed Delay)

```java
scheduler.scheduleWithFixedDelay(() -> {
    System.out.println("Running at " + System.currentTimeMillis());
}, 0, 2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```

‚úÖ Output:

```
Running at 10:00:00.000
Running at 10:00:02.000
Running at 10:00:04.000
```

üí° `scheduleWithFixedDelay()`

* Runs every **2 seconds after the previous one completes**.

So if a task takes 1s, next starts after **1s + 2s = 3s total gap**.

---

### üß† Difference Between `FixedRate` and `FixedDelay`

| Method          | Interval Measurement                  | Example                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Fixed Rate**  | From task **start** to next **start** | Like a heartbeat (every X seconds)            |
| **Fixed Delay** | From task **end** to next **start**   | Like a recurring timer (wait after finishing) |

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

| Concept           | Description                                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Exception Safety  | A failed task doesn‚Äôt kill the scheduler thread (unlike Timer). |
| Thread Pooling    | Multiple threads can run multiple scheduled tasks concurrently. |
| Graceful Shutdown | Always call `shutdown()` or `shutdownNow()` to release threads. |

---

### üí° Real-World Use Cases

‚úÖ Cron-like jobs (cleanups, sync tasks, retries)
‚úÖ Metrics polling, log flushing, monitoring
‚úÖ Rate-limited request dispatching
‚úÖ Auto-saving editor state

| Executor Type            | Threads | Queue Type          | Best For              | Risk                    |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **SingleThreadExecutor** | 1 fixed | LinkedBlockingQueue | Sequential tasks      | Slow if one task blocks |
| **FixedThreadPool**      | Fixed   | LinkedBlockingQueue | Predictable workloads | Queue overflow          |

| **ScheduledThreadPool**  | Fixed   | DelayedWorkQueue    | Delayed/Periodic jobs | Forgetting to shutdown  |

---

### üß© TL;DR

> * **SingleThreadExecutor** ‚Üí sequential, one worker.
> * **FixedThreadPool** ‚Üí stable, controlled parallelism.
> * **CachedThreadPool** ‚Üí elastic, no queue, fast bursts.
> * **ScheduledThreadPool** ‚Üí time-based execution, reliable timer replacement.
